    My name is Jalen Mendonca. I am a Canadian citizen who was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario.
    In 2019 I began studying "Game - Programming" at Centennial College. I had no experience with coding before beginning this program, and I have learned a lot within the past year.
    I am intending to transfer to the "Software Engineering Technician" program next semester, and I expect to receive my Ontario College Diploma by 2021.
    After this I am planning on continuing my education at Centennial College by enrolling in their Cybersecurity certificate program.
    
    My passion for information technology began through my usage of computers and video game systems throughout my entire life.
    I have always been intrigued by the "black box" nature of computing, and I am always curious to understand how these different systems work behind the scenes.
